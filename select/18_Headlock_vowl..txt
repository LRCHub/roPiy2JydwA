You know you're better than this

You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it

You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock (How can you)
I don't believe any of it (believe any of it)

You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

You know you're better than this
