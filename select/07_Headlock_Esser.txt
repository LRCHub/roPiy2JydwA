Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now

Stamp me in the carpet like a piece of dirt
If the words fail then you just floor me
I've got a problem, it's called living
When will I learn that you're no good for me

Oh, you got me in a right state
You got me messin' up all my plans
Oh, you got me in a right state
You got me livin' like a desperate man

Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now
Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now

Bury me inside like a knackered stallion
You've noticed that my arms havn't moved much lately
You press the button and I start dancin'
I keep on coming back just for you to hate me

Oh, you got me in a right state
You got me messin' up all my moves
Oh, you got me in a right state
You got me living like a desperate youth

Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now
Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now

Roundhouse kicks keep knocking me backwards
Your desperate world is bringing me down
I'm going to to learn how to throw punches
I'm sick and tired of being kicked around

Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now
Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now

Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now
Oh, you got me in a headlock
Nothing in the world's gonna help me now
