[00:01.14] Fifteen years old, secretly tryna find
[00:04.49] Skin whitening cream on the internet
[00:13.55] Wanna disappear, wanna fade into the atmosphere
[00:17.19] And I can't even drive yet
[00:30.19] 
[00:25.44] Twenty-one years old and it all comes rushing back at me
[00:37.59] Start sobbing as I crown the girl I tried to burn in effigy
[00:43.28] Think of the king and queen
[00:44.69] And the dragons that they slayed for me
